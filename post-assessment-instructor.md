#### In each of the following scenarios, please select the answer that best applies to your concept of the average participant for this bootcamp:
#### 1. A tab-delimited file has two columns showing the date and the highest temperature on that day. The participant is asked to write a program to produce a graph showing the average highest temperature for each month.
* They could not complete this task.
* They could complete the task with documentation or search engine help.
* They could complete the task with little or no documentation or search engine help.

#### 2a. How familiar do you think the average participant is with GIT version control?
* They are not familiar with GIT.
* They are familiar only with the name GIT.
* They are familiar with GIT up to the point of using it.
* They are familiar with GIT because they have or am using it.

#### 2b. Answer only if you answered (4) on the previous question. The average participant is given the URL for a project on GitHub, asked to check out a working copy of that project, add a file called notes.txt, and commit the change.
* They could not complete this task.
* They could complete the task with documentation or search help.
* They could complete the task with little or no documentation or search help.


#### 3a. How familiar do you think you are with unit testing and code coverage? 
* They are not familiar with unit testing or code coverage.
* They are familiar only with the name unit testing or code coverage.
* They are familiar with unit testing or code coverage up to the point of using it.
* They are familiar with unit testing or code coverage because they have or are using it.

#### 3b. Answer only if you answered (4) on the previous question. Given a 200-line function to test, could the average participant write half a dozen tests using a unit testing framework and use code coverage to check that they exercise every line of the function.
* They could not complete this task.
* They could complete the task with documentation or search engine help.
* They could complete the task with little or no documentation or search engine help.

#### 4a. How familiar do you think the average participant is with SQL?
1. They are not familiar at all with SQL.
2. They are familiar only with the name SQL.
3. They are familiar with SQL up to the point of using it.
4. They are familiar with SQL because they have or are using it.

#### 4b. Answer only if you answered (4) on the previous question. A database has two tables Scientist and Lab. Scientist's columns are the scientist's user ID, name, and email address; Lab's columns are lab IDs, lab names, and scientist IDs. The average participant is asked to write an SQL statement that outputs the count of the number of scientists in each lab.
* They could not complete this task.
* They could complete the task with documentation or search engine help.
* They could complete the task with little or no documentation or search engine help.

#### 5a. How familiar do you think you are with the command line?
1. They are not familiar at all with the command line.
2. They are familiar only with the name command line.
3. They are familiar with the command line up to the point of using it.
4. They are familiar with the command line because they have or are using it.

#### 5b. Answer only if you answered (4) on the previous question. How would the average participant solve this problem? A directory contains 1000 text files. Create a list of all files that contain the word "Drosophila" and save the result to a file called results.txt.
* They could not create this list.
* They would create this list using "Find in Files" and "copy and paste".
* They would create this list using basic command line programs.
* They would create this list using a pipeline of command line programs.
